Installing VScode
![image](1.png)
I visited the Visual Studio Code website, <https://code.visualstudio.com/>, in accordance with the instructions to download and install it on my computer.

Remotely Connecting

I opened a terminal in VS Code. And then use the command:
``````
$ ssh cs15lwi23awx@ieng6.ucsd.edu.
``````
Then I typed in my password to complete the login.

Trying Some Commands

I tried different ways to run the commands cd, ls, pwd. I used Ctrl-D to log out of the remote server.
``cd`` means "change directory." This command changes the directory to the absolute path or relative path to the path after cd command
``pwd`` means "print working directory," which gives an absolute path of the current working directory.
``ls`` means "list," this command list all the documents and folders in the current path.
